# Custom React Native Snippets

This repository contains few of the snippets that i use in my react native videos on my youtube channel.

## Setup Instructions (VSCODE)

- Open Visual Studio Code

- CODE > PREFERENCES > USER SNIPPETS > **javascriptreact.json/jsx-attr.json/jsx.json**

- Copy the code from this repository into that file.

## Issues :

- In case your javascriptreact.json snippets don't work, try and copy it into :

- CODE > PREFERENCES > USER SNIPPETS > **javascript.json**
